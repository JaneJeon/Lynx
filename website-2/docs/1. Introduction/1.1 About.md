> Modern, lightweight, planet-scale link shortener for teams ðŸŽ‰
>
> Easy to setup, connect with your org's SSO, hook up analytics, and extend!

Blink is a link shortener that is:

- _Simple and Lightweight_: the simple "base" architecture means you can literally host it for free, and maintenance is easy.
- _Planet-Scale_: you can host Blink alone for simplicity, or put a CDN in front of it to scale out Blink and easily plug in your own analytics!
- _For Teams_: external identity/SSO via OIDC/OAuth support is baked right into Blink; no need to pay $$$$$ or hack together SSO support via reverse proxies! Plus, baked in access control (RBAC)!
- _Extensible_: not only does it have a REST API, but it also allows you to integrate it with public applications by protecting API calls with OAuth2!

_For development, see the GitHub repo's [README](https://github.com/JaneJeon/blink)_

This project is based off of [Express-Objection-Template](https://github.com/JaneJeon/express-objection-template), and heavily uses [objection-authorize](https://github.com/JaneJeon/objection-authorize) and [objection-hashid](https://github.com/JaneJeon/objection-hashid) to drive much of "hidden" logic and make isomorphism possible.
